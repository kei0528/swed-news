Help me making the initial monorepo setup. It should use docker.

This project has three directories:

- collector
- enricher
- processor
- publisher

Each directory has very simple typescript setup using tsx. For now just create index.ts file in each directory. Add very basic eslint and prettier config in each directory.

Also Postgres should be hosted using docker.
